# aleph-sdk-ts

## Description
aleph-sdk-ts is the Typescript SDK you can use to interact with the Aleph decentralized network, about which you can find more information [here](https://aleph.im/).

When I started this project, it was just for adding TS support to the [Aleph-JS](https://github.com/aleph-im/aleph-js) project.
This project is still under development, please consider this if you are using it.
