# @aleph-sdk/core
The @aleph-sdk/core package provides essential utilities and shared constants necessary for development with the @aleph-sdk.
It features a collection of functions to aid in URL management, environment detection, and timing, alongside an enumeration of supported blockchain networks.
Designed for both Node.js and browser environments, this package is a foundational component for building blockchain applications with Aleph.

See [@aleph-sdk/client](https://npmjs.com/package/@aleph-sdk/client) or the [offical docs](https://docs.aleph.im) as the entrypoint for developing with aleph.im.
