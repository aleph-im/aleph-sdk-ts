# @aleph-sdk/nuls2
The @aleph-sdk/nuls2 package facilitates interaction with the NULS2 blockchain for account management and message signing within the Aleph.im ecosystem. It leverages cryptographic standards and blockchain utilities to create, import, encrypt, decrypt, and sign messages using NULS2 protocol accounts.

See [@aleph-sdk/client](https://npmjs.com/package/@aleph-sdk/client) or the [offical docs](https://docs.aleph.im) as the entrypoint for developing with aleph.im.

## Features
