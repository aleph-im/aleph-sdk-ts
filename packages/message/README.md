# @aleph-sdk/message
This package, part of the [aleph.im](https://aleph.im) SDK, provides a comprehensive API for creating, retrieving, updating (amending), and deleting (forgetting) messages on the aleph.im network.

See [@aleph-sdk/client](https://npmjs.com/package/@aleph-sdk/client) or the [offical docs](https://docs.aleph.im) as the entrypoint for developing with aleph.im.
