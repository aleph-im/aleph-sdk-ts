This package provides essential functionalities for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based accounts to interact with the Aleph.im network. It includes utilities for managing blockchain network connections, signing messages, and verifying signatures using EVM-compatible wallets, such as MetaMask or custom JSON-RPC providers.
