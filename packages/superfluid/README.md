# @aleph-sdk/superfluid
The @aleph-sdk/superfluid package integrates Aleph.im's account management capabilities with the Superfluid protocol on the Avalanche network. It is designed to facilitate seamless interactions with the Superfluid protocol, enabling users to manage real-time finance streams with ALEPH tokens in a decentralized manner.

See [@aleph-sdk/client](https://npmjs.com/package/@aleph-sdk/client) or the [offical docs](https://docs.aleph.im) as the entrypoint for developing with aleph.im.

## Features
- Easily manage ALEPH token streams on the Superfluid protocol directly from Aleph.im accounts.
- Utilize functions to increase or decrease ALEPH flow rates to other addresses, providing greater control over streaming finance applications.
- Query for ALEPH balance, flow rate to a receiver, net flow rate of the account, and detailed inflow and outflow records, integrating financial streaming logic into your decentralized applications.
- Leverage compatibility with Avalanche and multiple network IDs for broader access and functionality.
